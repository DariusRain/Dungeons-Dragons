# D&D rules: <br>
#### To determine if an attack results in a hit:
1. Roll a d20
2. If a 20 is rolled this is considered a Natural 20 <br>
    * This is considered critical (roll damage again)
3. If a 1 is rolled this is a natural 1 and is considered a critical miss.
4. After the roll add the attack modifier
5. If total is above targets AC + defense modifier then the attack lands and damage should be calculated by rolling the damage dice of the attack
